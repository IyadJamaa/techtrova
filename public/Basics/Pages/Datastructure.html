      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Data structures refer to the organization and storage of data in a
        computer's memory, while algorithms are a set of instructions or rules
        that manipulate and process that data. These two concepts are
        intertwined and form the backbone of software engineering. Data
        structures provide a way to store and organize data, enabling efficient
        access, modification, and retrieval, while algorithms define the steps
        and procedures to perform various operations on the stored data.

        <p>
          Data structures and Algorithms is a huge topic in computer science,
          and in most of the jobs interviews in the software engineer field,
          you're required to do some problem solving using some of those
          algorithms you will be learning today. (so you basically have a way to
          guaranteed you will pass a interview, so do your best to understand
          this concept)

          A Data structures and algorithms provide a systematic approach to
          problem-solving. They enable programmers to break down complex
          problems into smaller, more manageable components, allowing for
          step-by-step analysis and efficient implementation. By understanding
          different data structures and algorithms, developers can choose the
          most appropriate approach to solve a particular problem, leading to
          optimized solutions.

      <h1>Materials</h1>
      <p>
        Data structures and Algorithms is a huge course and heavy course, so
        take your time learning it and practicing problem solving, you should
        also study it in parallel with other basics.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Note that you will not be using all the algorithms in your daily
        coding/software enginnering job, so focus on the main topics that you
        will be using to improve your coding skills for now, the main Algorithms
        are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Arrays</li>
        <li>search</li>
        <li>sorting</li>
        <li>Recursion</li>
        <li>Linked List</li>
        <li>Trees</li>
        <li>Heap</li>
        <li>Graphs</li>
        <li>Hashing</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>
        There are a couple of source to learn Data structures and Algorithms
        depending on which programming language you decided to learn,
      </p>

      <p>
        We highly recommend <u>Frontend Master's</u> course
        <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/">
          The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need</a
        >
        it's free when you sign up, but it's taught in Typescript (it would be
        relatively easier for you if you know JavaScript as Typescript is just
        JavaScript with syntax for type) so give the
        <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/">docs</a> a quick and
        through look.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also recommend a book called
        <a
          href="https://edu.anarcho-copy.org/Algorithm/grokking-algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious.pdf"
        >
          grokking Algorithms</a
        >
        which you should give it a read with any course you took for Data
        structures and Algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        a highly recommend course for Data structures and Algorithms is<a
          href="https://neetcode.io/courses"
        >
          neetcode.io</a

      <h1>Problem solving</h1>
      <p>
        Practice, practice and practice, we can't emphasize enough how important
        is to problem solve especially with Data structures and Algorithms.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Data structures and Algorithms, you should practice problem solving
        on<a href="https://leetcode.com/"> leetcode</a> and in order to not get
        lost in leetcode,
        <a href="https://neetcode.io/roadmap"> neetcode </a>offers a great
        roadmap to navigate through the many problems on leetcode.
      </p>
      <p>Note:</p>
      <p>
        When solving a problem on leetcode give it it's time before giving up
        and looking for the answer.
